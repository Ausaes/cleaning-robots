# Cleaning Robots## Ô∏è **Project Overview**This project implements an application to control autonomous cleaning robots in a factory. The robots navigate a rectangular grid, executing commands to clean efficiently and move accurately within the designated area.## **Rich Domain Model**The project follows a rich domain model, where business logic is encapsulated within the domain objects (`Robot`, `Position`, `Grid`, `Orientation`). This approach provides several benefits:- **High Cohesion** ‚Äì Logic is close to the data it manipulates, simplifying maintenance and reducing duplication.- **Modularity** ‚Äì Domain objects are independent and reusable, making the system easier to extend.- **Consistency** ‚Äì Business rules are consistently enforced within domain objects, reducing potential errors.## **Architecture**- **Infrastructure Layer** ‚Äì Handles input and output (`InputProcessor`).- **Application Layer** ‚Äì Contains services (`CleanService`) to coordinate operations.- **Domain Layer** ‚Äì Defines entities and business rules (`Robot`, `Position`, `Grid`, `Orientation`).## **Usage**1. Enter grid dimensions.2. Enter the robot's initial position and orientation. 3. Enter movement commands (`L`, `R`, `M`).4. Press `Enter` to finish.## **Example**```text5 5 1 2 N LMLMLMLMM 3 3 E MMRMMRMRRM```the output will be```text1 3 N 5 1 E```## üìå **Technologies**- Java 23- Maven- JUnit 5
